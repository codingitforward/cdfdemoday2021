**Nikasha Patel** is a rising senior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying Computation and Cognition. This summer, she worked at the U.S. Census Bureau in the Policy and Data Stewardship Branch, which is responsible for implementing agency-wide use of the Data Management System to register datasets and initiate projects. At the Bureau, registered datasets in the Data Management System (DMS) are required to list the location of their metadata in the Administrative Record share (ADREC), which is a data warehouse containing all the source metadata needed for datasets. However, many DMS datasets are missing links to their ADREC location, which makes it difficult for Bureau researchers and information owners to find the datasets they’re looking for. Nikasha utilized data cleaning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to find hundreds of missing ADREC locations efficiently and accurately so that researchers can find metadata quickly. | [Presentation](Nikasha_Patel.pdf)
