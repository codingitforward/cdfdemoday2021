### Introduction
The Civic Digital Fellowship is a first-of-its-kind internship for mission-driven, student software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and designers to innovate at the intersection of technology and public service.

We are grateful for agency partners who provided our Fellows with the opportunity to serve and grow this summer: the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/), [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/), the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/), the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/), [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/), [Kessel Run](https://kesselrun.af.mil/), the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/), and [U.S. Special Operations Command](https://www.socom.mil/). The Civic Digital Fellowship also wouldn't be possible without support from our generous supporters: Schmidt Futures and the Ford Foundation.
